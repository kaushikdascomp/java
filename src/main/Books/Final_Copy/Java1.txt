We can create constructors for abstract class

An abstract class can have both abstract and non abstract methods
Though oject of abstract class cannot be created bt if a concrete class implements an abstract class then all its methods are 
inherited and if the abstract class contains non abstract methods constructor of abstract class is automatically invoked

When any class extends abstract class constructor of sub class will invoke constructor of super class either implicitly or 
explicitly

Diff Between <List> and <Set>
List-Oredered set of list where indexing can be done with elements but there may exist duplicate data also and positional access
is possible
Set- Unordered set of list of elements but only distinct elements exists and positional access is not possible

If you try to insert a duplicate value in Set, it will replace the original one.

String and StringBuffer--

String is mutable object and any change in the string object will result in creation of another string 
While in StringBuffer, any modifications done in the STring object, no new objects are created
String is immutable in Java i.e. String uses pass by reference

A class can be created as immutable by calling the class name as final and the method name should be specified as final 
with no setter method
An immutable class compiles and run faster by synchronizing the code.It is thread safe. It has many disadvantages of creating garbage and creation of lot of garbage can slow 
down the application

Hashcode-Main purpose is to geneate a unique integer for each object on the heap
a.equals(b) also means a.hashcode()==b.hashcode() but reverse is not true

Singleton class-Only one object can be created and that too inside the same class



Access levels in JAva
Public - can be used anywhere in entire project
protected-available only to own class, subclass and package. If extends in a different package it can  access it
private-availabe only self class

Java Collections Framework

diff between linked list and arraylist

in arraylist elements can be accessed directly by index but addition and deletion s a problem for which entire list needs to be moved
Its just like arrays and linked list
In linked list searching and traversing a list takes long time as it cannot index it but addition and deletion is easy

Sorted collection
collections.sort()-can sort a list but its one time sorted list while priorityqueue maintains a ordered list at all time 
and only head element is accessible

You cannot create instance of enums using new operator because constructor of enums in Java is only private
and enum constants can only be created inside enums
An enum can be declared outside or inside a class but not in method

Enums can contain constructors, methods, variables and constant class bodies
enum constructors can NEVER be invoked directly in code. They are always called automatically when an enum is initialized.
enum constructors can have arguments, and can be overloaded.
