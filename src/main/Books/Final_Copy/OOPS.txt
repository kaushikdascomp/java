POlymorphism-Method Overloading-COmpile time polymorphism
If you just change the retun type of any method without changing the argument list then it is a type of method overriding not overloading
You must change the argument list of the method in order to do method overloading although the return type can be changed for method overloading


For method overriding, the return type and entire method is changed withput changing the argument type
