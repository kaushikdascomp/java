Writing a serialized object to file:
1. Make a FileOutputStream-write bytes to a file
2. Make a ObjectOutputstream-Turn objects into data that can be written into stream
3. Write the object using writeobject method

Serialization cannot be applied to static variables because serialization is one per class not one per object

Transient variable are not serialized and when we deserialoze it it returns null value

To avoid sub class not being serialized need to implement writeobject and readobject in your class which throws
notserializableException from those methods 
Static and transient variables are not serialized

If one of the object of the class doesn't implement serializable interface and the object includes a reference to a
non serializable class then a NotSerializableException will be thrown at runtime
