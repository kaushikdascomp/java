Clone() method generates a duplicate copy of the object on which it is called. It does not contain any methods or member variables.
It is used for tagging a class that this class is cloneable and when implemented, it will clone the object

cloning is followed by try/catch blocks. The class must implement cloneable interface
return (TestClone)<Name of the class> super.clone();--This is inside a method cloneTest

When we want to clone an object just call the method

TestClone x1=new TestClone();
testClone x2;
x2=x1.cloneTest// Which clones x1
