Get and Load
Load will return a proxy object from the hibernate cache i.e from session without hitting the database and if no object is
found in the cache, it will throw ObjectNotFoundException.
Load provides better performance becuase it supports lazy loading and we should use this method only when we are clear
that the object exists in the cache else it will throw ObjectNotFoundException
Session.get always hits the database and return the real object/persisted from the database and if no row is found it will 
return null.

get():
1) Returns null if object is not found.
2) get() method always hit the database.
3) It returns real object not proxy.
4) It should be used if you are not sure about the existence of INSTANCE.
load():
1) Throws ObjectNotFoundException if object is not found.
2) load() method doesn't hit the database.
3) It returns proxy object.
4) It should be used if you are sure that instance exists.
