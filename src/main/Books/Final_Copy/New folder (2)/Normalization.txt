Normalization is the process of eliminating data redundancies and efficiently organizing the data in the DB. It is a process of breaking into smaller
tables thus reducing anomalies. Tradeoff between normalization and performance because joining of tables is required based on primary key

Two purpose of Normalization: Eliminating Redundant Data,ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e. storing only related data in related tables

2NF-Not partial dependency of any collumn on primary key, but all fields must be fully dependant on primary key

3NF- Completely no duplicate rows. There may be case where fields are dependent on student_id but address, street depends on zip and zip is not redundant
In this case make it a separate table with zip as primary key. The dependancy between zip and other fields is called tansitive dependancy
Thus the transitive functional dependency is removed from the table

BCNF-Boyce-Codd Normal Form-Does not have multiple overlapping candidate keys
