Select a pivot element
Check for element smaller than pivot in the left list before pivot. If it is less than increment pointer till it finds a larger element greater than the pivot
Stop and fix the value of pointer suppose for i=3 found that value is larger than pivot
Then search from right side value greater than the pivot element
If value is greater decrement the pointer value suppose j is the pointer so decrement it till it finds any value which is smaller than the pivot
Stop and fix the value of pointer j which is smaller

Now exchange the values of i and j while checking(i<=j)
pointer of i should be less than j which checks that it is not the end of the list
