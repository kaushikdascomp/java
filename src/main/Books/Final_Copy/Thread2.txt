Synchronized block and synchronized method-
http://www.xyzws.com/Javafaq/what-are-the-differences-between-synchronized-method-and-synchronized-block-statement/84

sync block syncs on object and locks the specific object wherever necessary improving system performance

One object n two sync methods of same obj, but if one thread of obj enters one of the method, then no other thread of same obj or diff obj can 
access the other method

but in case of sync block, if
locks of diff objects

Transient and volatile modifiers:
When an instance variable is declared as volatile then its value need not persist when an object is stored

Volatile modifier tells the compiler that the variable modified by volatile can be changed unexpectedly by any parts of the program
Mostly used in multi threaded applications where one thread may change the variable value to other

Error and Exception- Error is a type of runtime exception which we cannot handle it/Unchecked Exception. It cannot be recovered like out of memory
so it is not put under try/catch blocks
