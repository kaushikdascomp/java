Synchronization in Hashmap
Concurrent HashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap(HashMap)
CHM-synchronizes only particular segments of Map, so other segments where lock is not obtained can be accessed easily whereas synchronizedMap 
applies lock on the whole collection object so each thread operation will access the object by get/put one at a time

Diff between HashTable and COllections.synchronizedMap- Both are almost equal as both provides complete synchronization and performance is also same
But HashTable is a legacy class promoted to collections framework and has extra features like enumerators

ThreadSafe:
Collection.synchronizedList(List)
Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)
Collections.synchronizedSet(Set)
