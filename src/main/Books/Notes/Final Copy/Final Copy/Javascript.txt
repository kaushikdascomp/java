Types used in Javascript:
String, Number, Boolean, Function, Object, Null, undefined
Undefined-means a variable that has been declared has not been assigned any value
Null-representation of no value
undefined is a type itself(undefined) whereas null is an object
Unassigned variables are initialized by Javascript with a default value undefined while null is an object

=== checks for value and type also

Local variables are declared with "var" while global variables are declared without "var"
