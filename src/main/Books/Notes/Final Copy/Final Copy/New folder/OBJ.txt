Pre operator ++a=first increment then store
post first store then increment

++ preference more importance than *. So pre ++a is incremented first and then operated
first increase it then store
y=++a First increment and store the value after increment, y=a++; value will be stored before increment

When a floating point number is casted to an integer, it simply loses the fractional part
int x=(int)888.88
result 888

All trancendental math functions return double by default. So we have to cast integer or whichever feasible to typecast it

Char occupies 16bit i.e. 2^16 0~65535 in memory

Operator preference(Higest to lowest)--(),++,*,>>

&,^,?

Printing an object will print the address of the memory
All object of a class are allotted memory for the all the variables defined in the class
Default constructor is called at the time of declaration of the object if a constructor has not been defined
Constructor can be parameterized
Finalize method must be protected

Finalize method is called just prior to garbage collection and it is not called when object goes out of scope
