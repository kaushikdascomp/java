Four componenets of J2EE--

Application Client components
Servlet and JSP are web components
Business Components(JavaBeans)
Resource Adapter components
 
JSF-UI designing framework for Java web applications. It provides a set of resuable UI components

Hashtable is a collection synchronized object. It does not allow duplicate values but allows null values

Instance variable initializer is like declaring a string and then defining it
public class foo{

String s="abc";
public foo(){
sysout.println("");
}
}

Sub class constructor has to invoke superclass constructor either explicitly by programmer or implicitly by compiler

eg. class super{
string s;
public super(){
sysout.println("super");
}
public static sub extends super{
public sub(){
sysout.println("sub")
}
public static void main(string args[]){
sub d=new sub();
}

which prints super and sub
inside sub() method compiler explicitly calls super() method;

Thus while creating an object of the subclass, invokes also the constructor of the superclass

An objects's life and death depends on the life of the references referring to it. If the reference is alive on the stack, the object is still
alive on the heap and when the reference is removed, the garbage collector removes the objec from heap
