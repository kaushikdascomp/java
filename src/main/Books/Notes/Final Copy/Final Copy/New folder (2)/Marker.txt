Marker Interfaces have no methods declared inside them and classes implemeneting the marker interfaces don't have to override any of the methods
Eg- Serializable and Cloneable
These interfaces is used to force some kind of functionality in the classes by providing some functionality to a class if it implements the marker
interface

Serializable can be used with ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream class

marker interfaces are interfaces with no field or methods/empty interface in java is called a Marker Interface 

If a class is serializable it performs some special operation on it

Also called tagging interface which tags and lets us know that this class is serializable.
Basically it's a design pattern which is used by many languages to provide run time information about the object
