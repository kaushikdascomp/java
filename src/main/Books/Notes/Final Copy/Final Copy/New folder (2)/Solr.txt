Solr v/s elastic search-SOLR runs on JVM, so if the JVM crashes, the entire application will crash but it is mature with full fledged capabilities

SOLR uses XML, CSV,jSON format whereas ES uses only JSON

Solr positions itself as a tool for enterprise search whereas ES seems to have positioned itself for more analytics (ie, ELK). 

Elasticsearch basically beat the Solr committers to the punch in creating a way to easily scale multiple instances or Lucene across a large number of servers.
