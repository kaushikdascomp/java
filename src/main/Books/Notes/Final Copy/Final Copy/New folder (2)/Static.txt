Without creating objecs of the class, a static block can be called
ex. class test{ 
static int i; 
static{
i=10;
}
} 
main block{
sysout.println(Test.i)
Static blocks are called only once, no matter how many times we call the constructor
Static local variables are not allowed in Java
Static methods, classes and instance variables can be created in Java. Static classes are like nested classes/ but not inner classes

Complex c1=new Complex(10,15); Complex c2=new Complex(10,15);(c1==c2). So both are not equal as two are creating two object references which are 
different but in case of string, both will point to same reference object
but .equals method compares the content of two different object references which are equal

You can access static instance variables and methods from a static method. Also, you can access the static instance variable without instantiating
the class. But static method cannot access non static variable without instantiating the class

Whereas a non-static method in a class can always call a static method in a class or access a static variable
