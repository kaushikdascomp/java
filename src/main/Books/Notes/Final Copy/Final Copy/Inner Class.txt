Inner classes are of 4 types::
Static member classes-has access to all static memebers/methods of the parent
Member Classes-It has access to all memebers/methods of the parent
Local Classes-Declared within a block of code and are visible only in that block. Suppose the class is declared inside a method of outer class
So whenever we call the outer class method, the inner class and its method are automatically called

Local inner classes can't use local variable of outer class until it is declared as final. Or else declare the local vriable inside the local
class

Local class has access to the members of the enclosing class

Anonymous classes-It has no name
