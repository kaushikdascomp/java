Every node in our Elasticsearch cluster uses the port 9300 to communicate with other nodes in the cluster. 
This is what allows for node discovery. Elasticsearch nodes expose another port, port 9200 for external communication. 
Port 9200 is the HTTP endpoint of the nodes in our cluster, this is where we send our search queries and analytical requests.

By default elastic search has 5 shards and 1 replica
