Attributes of Reactive Applications:
Event driven, scalable,resilient, responsive

Event driven applications support better concurrency and highly scalable asynchronous applications
Even after high load reactive applications are responsive.

Event Driven reactive Java is based on Observer pattern

Resilient:  Graceful error handling and failure management

RxJava default is single threaded unless we specify the multithreaded pattern.

All downstream applications depends on the single upstream scheduler unless specified in each downstream systems with a scheduler
Observer Cardinality:
SingleResult Stream
May Be result stream :: May or may not get a result	
Completable result stream :  Only successful or fail
